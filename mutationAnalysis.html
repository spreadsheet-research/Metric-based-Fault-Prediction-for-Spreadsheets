description: Evaluation of Mutation Operators

<h1>Description</h1>
  <p>
    The EUSES dataset used in our evaluations comprises real-world spreadsheets that contain artificially injected faults.
    The faults were created by applying previously suggeested mutation operators on randomly chosen cells.
    The question now arisies to what extent the resulting spreadsheets can be considered as representative of realistic cases of faulty spreadsheets.
    To answer this question, compared the result EUSES dataset with the known, genuine faults contained in the Enron Errors dataset.
  </p>
  <p>
    Specifically, we manually inspected each sheet of the Enron Errors dataset, and checked how many of the real-world faults in each sheet can also be introduced by the (repeated) application of the mutations that were used to create the EUSES dataset.
    According to this analysis, 20 of the 31 fault types that were found in sheets of the Enron Errors corpus can be created by using mutations.
    We regard this result as a strong indication that our artificially created sheets are realistic and, for example, contain real-world faults like typos.
    We used the <a title="overview of Enron Errors dataset" href="http://ls13-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/homepage/spreadsheets/enron-errors.htm">spreadsheet containing an overview of the Enron Errors dataset</a> to document this analysis, and extended it with respective information regarding the reproducibility of the different fault types using mutation operators.
    The resulting sheet is available <a title=".xlsx file for mutation analysis" href="appendix/data/mutationAnalysis/EnronErrors_mutationComparison.xlsx">here</a>.
